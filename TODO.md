- Refactor the giant blob of crap that is the primary processing function.
    - This probably includes moving the ad hoc HashMaps and HashSets into a proper state structure.
- Figure out why timestamps aren't being persisted.
- Implement executable bit support.
- Handle adding branches to existing repositories.
- Handle updating existing repostories with new commits.
- Is there any way to speed this up? (Probably not, short of implementing a CVS client or exporting directly to a CVSROOT.)
